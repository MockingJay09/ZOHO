*ZOHO INTERVIEW QUESTION L3*
  
I have given a program that behaves like Transcation query language from sql
the query are:
  --> SET - sets the variable to the value (ex: SET a 20)
  --> UNSET - sets the variable to the null value (ex: UNSET a)
  --> GET - fetchs the variable value (ex: GET a)
  --> UPDATE - updates the variable value (ex: UPDATE a 20)
  --> COUNT - count the variable value (ex: COUNT 10)
  --> BEGIN - begins a new transaction (ex: BEGIN)
  --> ROLLBACK - rollbacks whatever transaction command is given [before last commit/rollback] (ex: ROLLBACK)

:: My methods involves using 'class data structure' to hold the data of each flow of commands and creating an 'vector of object of the class'
  the each object in the vector contains the data of the flow (objects)

:: i use two index variables i and j, these variable are used to keep track of certain parameters;
    --> i is used to fetch the end index of my vector
    --> j is used to avoid the rollback even if the object query is commited

:: at the begin of my program i initiate the program by pushing a object into the vector,
   the changes will be made in this object data,
   if this changes is not commited then there is a possibility of rolling it back,
   so only if i get the COMMIT command from the user, i will push a copy of my object into my vector.
   if i get ROLLBACK command i must check whether the previous queries have been commited;
    -->if so i will throw an statement "the queries as been committed"
    -->if not i will rollback by poping the end of my vector

:: this is the basic apporach using class and objects. i have not optimized the count function in this program. this solution is not the best 
   but it gives the gist of how to approach a program with a rollback facility.

!HAPPY LEARNING!
